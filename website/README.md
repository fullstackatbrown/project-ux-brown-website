# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Instructions for Use
### Events Page
Events can be added to the events page by adding the event to the total_board section of the website/src/events/events.js file. You can customize the name, image, event link and time for each event. To account for time zone difference, the date of the event is configured using Coordinated Universal Time. For example, new Date(Date.UTC(2021, 6, 20, 2, 5)) is 10:05pm EST, July 19th. Date.UTC takes 5 arguments: year, month, day, hour, minute. It's important to know that the month is zero-indexed, so January is 0, February is 1, etc. Also be sure to set the date and time correctly in UTC. In the example, the date is July 20th in UTC, but is July 19th in Eastern Time. Events will automatically be moved from the "Upcoming events" to "Past events" section based on the time you put for the date.

To support the "Add to calendar" button, follow the instructions here: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en#zippy=%2Cshare-as-a-link After making a public calendar and adding your desired events, click on an event, click the three dots in the top right corner and then choose "Publish event."  This will generate a link to allow users to add the event to their own google calendar. Allowing users to add events to their own calendar will not change the events on your calendar, so your guests won't be able to accidentally change the name or time on your calendar in the process of adding it to their own.
